# A Map of Tiny Perfect Things

### Notebooks

- 01_data_wrangling_google_maps: get data from Google Sheets, join together to create master data (`master_data.csv`), use Google Places API
 to get address among other details and save it all (`master_data_google_details.csv`).

### Notes

- Running the notebook 01 should get all the data in right format.
- Google gives $200 every month for free. This basically means we can do 20,000+ API calls for free. (Roughly 1000 calls cost $7).
- We need Location parameter in the sheets for it to be helpful.
