    <h1>Perfect Places</h1>
    <h2>The Map of Tiny Perfect Things</h2>
  
  Your stomach rumbles. Do you go to the Italian restaurant that you know and love, or the new Thai place that just opened up? Do you go to the cafe rated 4.6 stars on Google Maps that looks hip or the cafe that promises to provide an ambient reading environment? What about the momos stall that isn't even listed on Google Maps?

  <br><br>

  Is there an Atlas Obscura of restaurants, cafes, parks, hikes and viewpoints?

  <br><br>

  Until now, the answer was no. But starting today, <a href="https://deabardhoshi.github.io/">Dea</a> and <a href="https://www.harsh17.in/">Harsh</a> present to the world the first iteration of "The Map of Tiny Perfect Things".

  <br><br>

  <h2>What are Tiny Perfect Things?</h2>

  In the movie, <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Map_of_Tiny_Perfect_Things">A Map of Tiny Perfect Things</a>, Mark and Margaret had been living the same da over and over for several years. Every day, they woke up to the same routine where everyone, oblivious to what they did yesterday, did the exact same thing. Except the two of them. Eventually, Mark started making a map of the "tiny perfect things" in the world. Places where you had to be at the right time to observe something spectacular.

  <br><br>

  This map captures some of them from our (and now your) own experience. No AI, no robots, no machines. Good old crowd-based knowledge.

  <h2>How to use this map</h2>

  <h3>Explore</h3>

  You can explore places by clicking on the markers on the map. You can also filter places by choosing the type at the bottom of the map.

  <h3>Search</h3>

  If you are looking for a specific city, which you likely are, search the city name on the top right. You can also search for a specific place by name.

  <h3>Chat</h3>

  Ava is our in house expert of finding interesting places. She has been to all the places on the map, and she knows the atlas. You can ask her for recommendations by clicking on the chat icon on the top left, or <a href="https://perfectplaces.streamlit.app/">here</a>. She is still learning, so please be patient with her.
  
  <h2>How to contribute</h2>

  <h3>Adding a place</h3>

  To add a place, navigate to this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3zX9ItXAS6JM4cO9JdrQFSpNtew-AETsG88M7jPOhexa-Dg/viewform">Google Form</a>. You will be asked to enter the name of the place, location, and what makes this place special. Once you submit the form, we will do some sanity checks and add it to the map.

  <h3>Improving the map</h3>

  It is our dream to share best of the world with everyone. The codes to develop the map are on Github. We welcome contributions to improve the map interface. Please raise a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/harshvardhaniimi/perfect-places-map">this repo</a>.
